Opinion mining  for twitter
Opinion mining has attracted great interest in recent years. One of the most promising applications is analysis of opinions in social networks. Opinion mining in a broad sense is defined as the computational study of opinions, sentiments and emotions expressed in texts.

This code is an adaptation of the package sentiment https://github.com/timjurka/sentiment for Spanish language.
sentiment is an R package with tools for sentiment analysis including naive bayesian classifiers for positivity/negativity and emotion classification.

See my example in Spanish here: http://dlizcano.github.io/2014/04/30/Opinion-Mining-Tweets.html
Enjoy.
